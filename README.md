# GAN Learning Repository

Welcome to the GAN Learning Repository! This repository is designed to help you learn about Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) through code examples, tutorials, and project-based learning.

## Introduction

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of machine learning frameworks designed by Ian Goodfellow and his colleagues in 2014. GANs consist of two neural networks: a Generator and a Discriminator, which compete against each other in a zero-sum game. The Generator creates fake data that mimics real data, while the Discriminator tries to distinguish between real and fake data. This repository aims to provide a comprehensive learning path for understanding and implementing GANs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Git
- Virtualenv (optional but recommended)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone [https://github.com/khanabdulmajid/Genrative-Adversarial-Networks-101]
